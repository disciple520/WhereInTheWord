# WhereInTheWord
A personal project I created using Java. It is basically a Bible memory app in reverse.

My focus in this application was to practice implementing the things I learned reading through Uncle Bob's "Clean Code." A few things come to mind:
- I tried to make the code completely readable using good naming and syntax. 
- I used polymorphism, using the power of OOP to make the application extensible. 
- I attempted to follow the single-responsibility principle, keeping my classes and methods small.
- I began implementing some unit tests to prevent problems as the application gets larger.

If you look around and have some feedback, please shoot me an email!
