Romans|1|1|Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
Romans|1|2|which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans|1|3|concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh
Romans|1|4|and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans|1|5|through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,
Romans|1|6|including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,
Romans|1|7|To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|1|8|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
Romans|1|9|For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you
Romans|1|10|always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
Romans|1|11|For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—
Romans|1|12|that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
Romans|1|13|I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans|1|14|I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans|1|15|So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
Romans|1|16|For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
Romans|1|17|For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”
Romans|1|18|For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
Romans|1|19|For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
Romans|1|20|For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.
Romans|1|21|For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Romans|1|22|Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
Romans|1|23|and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
Romans|1|24|Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,
Romans|1|25|because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
Romans|1|26|For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;
Romans|1|27|and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
Romans|1|28|And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.
Romans|1|29|They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,
Romans|1|30|slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
Romans|1|31|foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
Romans|1|32|Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
Hebrews|2|1|Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
Hebrews|2|2|For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,
Hebrews|2|3|how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
Hebrews|2|4|while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
Hebrews|2|5|For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.
Hebrews|2|6|It has been testified somewhere, “What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him?
Hebrews|2|7|You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor,
Hebrews|2|8|putting everything in subjection under his feet.” Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
Hebrews|2|9|But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
Hebrews|2|10|For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
Hebrews|2|11|For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
Hebrews|2|12|saying, “I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”
Hebrews|2|13|And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again, “Behold, I and the children God has given me.”
Hebrews|2|14|Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
Hebrews|2|15|and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
Hebrews|2|16|For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.
Hebrews|2|17|Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews|2|18|For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
Hebrews|3|1|Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
Hebrews|3|2|who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.
Hebrews|3|3|For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
Hebrews|3|4|(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
Hebrews|3|5|Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
Hebrews|3|6|but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.
Hebrews|3|7|Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you hear his voice,
Hebrews|3|8|do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,
Hebrews|3|9|where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.
Hebrews|3|10|Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.’
Hebrews|3|11|As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’”
Hebrews|3|12|Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
Hebrews|3|13|But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
Hebrews|3|14|For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
Hebrews|3|15|As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
Hebrews|3|16|For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
Hebrews|3|17|And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews|3|18|And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
Hebrews|3|19|So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
